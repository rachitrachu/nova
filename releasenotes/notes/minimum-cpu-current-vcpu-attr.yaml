    The libvirt driver now honors the ``minimum_cpu`` flavor extra spec by
    setting the ``current`` attribute of the ``<vcpu>`` element in the domain
    XML. Nova preserves the flavor ``vcpus`` as the maximum and stores the
    ``minimum_cpu`` value in instance metadata, allowing guests to boot with
    fewer vCPUs and grow up to the flavor limit automatically.
